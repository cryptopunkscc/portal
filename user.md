# User Guide

This user guide explains how to install **Portal** with **Astral Apps**, and run them in the user's environment.

## Installing Portal

To install **Portal Environment** you have to obtain a copy of `portal-installer`, and execute it from command line:

```shell
./portal-installer
```

Or if you know the art, read [Contributor](./contributor.md) guide for more options.

## Running Portal

**Portal** starts **Astral Apps** through the [`portal-app`](./cmd/portal-app) service. 
You can start `portal-app` with tray icon by calling: 

```shell
portal t
```

Tray contains a shortcut to applications launcher and option to close portal environment. 
_If you start the launcher for the first time, most likely expect an empty window if no applications were installed._

If you are using OS without GUI or you just don't need tray icon, execute:

```shell
portal
```
_If you execute `portal`, then execute `portal t` the tray will be attached to the existing `portal-app` process._

## Installing Applications

Application can be installed using:

```shell
portal-app i <./path/to/bundle/or/containg/dir>
```

For example, you can try to install applications from the [./example](./example) directory:

```shell
portal-app i ./example
```

But this will work only if bundles were already generated by running:

```shell
portal-dev b ./example
```

## Running Application

You can run the installed app from the launcher accessible via tray, 
or from the command line by calling `portal` with the application name or package as the argument.
If you have no applications installed you can test the command by opening the embedded launcher (which is just an **HTML App**):

```shell
portal launcher
```

or using package name:

```shell
portal cc.cryptopunks.portal.launcher
```

## Portal Help

* cli launcher

```shell

```

```
